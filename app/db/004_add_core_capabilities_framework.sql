This includes the importance of not making assumptions about each individual''s personal experiences, but instead taking time to learn about the individual experiences of the autistic person. The capabilities detailed in this framework should be used in conjunction with a true understanding of each person''s experience of autism. With this understanding it will then be possible to move forward to the desired position of acceptance and appreciation of the autistic person''s uniqueness.
The human rights of autistic people (children, young people and adults) must always be maintained, including the right to satisfying and valued lives and to be treated with dignity and respect. They should have a home within their community, be able to develop and maintain relationships and lifestyles of their choosing, with the support they need to live healthy, safe and rewarding lives.
This domain includes understanding the numbers of autistic people in the population, the characteristics of autism and the impact which it often has. It also includes identification, assessment and diagnosis of autism, which is key to the wellbeing of autistic people and to ensure that effective support, referrals and adjustments can be made to enable them to live healthy, safe and rewarding lives.');
